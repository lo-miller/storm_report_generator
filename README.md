# Hurricane Data Tracker


## Description
**The prompt:** Use the NOAA Best Track Data (HURDAT2) to identify all hurricanes that have made landfall in Florida since 1900.  Output a report listing the name, date of landfall, and maximum wind speed for each event.  

Data: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/)

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo 
```
git clone [https://github.com/lo-miller/storm_report_generator.git](https://github.com/lo-miller/storm_report_generator.git)
```
- Install/update Ruby if needed 
- Install necessary gems (e.g. `gem install rspec`)

### Dependencies

* Language: Ruby (3.1.2) 
* Gems: 
  * [rspec](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec) (3.13.3)
  * [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) (3.1.5)

### Executing program

* Two options that should return the same output:
  1. `ruby runner.rb` 
  2. `ruby hurricane_data_parser.rb` 
  Comment out the appropriate line (`data_file` towards the top of the page) to run either the full data set or a shorter 5-storm test data set (this is faster if you want to run while making changes)
    
* To run tests, run rspec for the test file like below:
  * `rspec spec/hurricane_data_parser_spec.rb` or `rspec spec/storm_selector_spec` to run one spec file
    * (note: the specs are working for the first iteration but not yet complete for the second iteration of the application)



### File Notes
* runner.rb - this runner file calls the other classes to run the program
  * parser.rb - this class parses a text data file and outputs an array of storm data
  * storm_selector.rb - this class checks an array of storm data and returns storms that satisfy the requirements (in this case making landfall in Florida as a hurricane after 1900)
  * report_generator.rb - this class generates a .csv report to the reports folder given input data
* hurricane_data_parser.rb - this file does the same as the runner file plus associated classes, but is not broken out into classes/modules yet so it is harder to maintain. This was an early version of the code.
* spec - specs for the hurricane_data_parser.rb file and the runner.rb file plus associated classes live here
* reports - .csv reports generated by running the code are saved here

### Brainstorming, Coding Approach, Future Features, Learnings

See linked [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDzHgeGEOT4QLX7qzFmrtHpjiI5IqYe_6UhxfWsewCY/edit?tab=t.0) for my thought process, a list of what else I would include, and approach to iterating the problem.
